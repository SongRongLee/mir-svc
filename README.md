This repository implements the singing voice conversion method described in [Pitchnet: Unsupervised Singing Voice Conversion with Pitch Adversarial Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01852) along with multiple improvements regarding its conversion quality using PyTorch. Detailed surveys and experiments have been published as a master thesis, you can get it [here](https://www.airitilibrary.com/Publication/alDetailedMesh1?DocID=U0001-1107202111044100).

You can find demo audio files and comaprisons to the original PitchNet on our [demo website](https://songronglee.github.io/singing-voice-conversion/).

## Dataset
We use [NUS-48E](https://smcnus.comp.nus.edu.sg/nus-48e-sung-and-spoken-lyrics-corpus/) dataset throughout the whole project. You can download it and perform data preprocessing and augmentation below.


## Environment setup
Create a conda environment using `environment.yml`:  
`conda env create -f environment.yml`


## Scripts usage
**Notice: Make sure you are under the project root when executing these scripts!** 

### Data augmentation
This script will read through the given `$raw_dir` and generate folders with the same structure to `$output_dir`, containing augmented audio files next to the original ones.  

`python data_augmentation.py $raw_dir $output_dir --aug-type $aug_type`  
- `raw_dir`: Path to the raw data directory with the following structure:
```
-> $raw_dir/
├── ADIZ
│   ├── 01.wav
│   ├── 09.wav
│   ├── 13.wav
│   └── 18.wav
├── JLEE
│   ├── 05.wav
│   ├── 08.wav
│   ├── 11.wav
│   └── 15.wav
...
```  
- `output_dir`: Path to the directory to save the augmented and original files. The resulting structure will look like this:
```
-> $output_dir/
├── ADIZ
│   ├── 01_original.wav
│   ├── 01_aug_back.wav
│   ├── 01_aug_phase.wav
│   ├── 01_aug_back_phase.wav
│   ├── 09_original.wav
│   ├── 09_aug_back.wav
│   ├── 09_aug_phase.wav
│   ├── 09_aug_back_phase.wav
...
...
```  
- `aug_type`: Type of augmentation

### Data preprocessing
This script will read through the given `$raw_dir` and generate folders with the same structure to `$output_dir`, with each audio file processed as a `*.h5` data file ready to be read by dataset classes.  

`python data_preprocess.py $raw_dir $output_dir --model $model`  
- `raw_dir`: Path to the raw data directory
- `output_dir`: Path to the directory to save the processed files
- `model`: Target model type which we are doing data preprocessing for

### Start training
This script will train the model. If `--model-path` is given, the training will continue with that checkpoint. To see other training parameters, run the script with `-h`.  

`python train.py $train_data_dir $model_dir --model $model --model-path $model_path`  
- `train_data_dir`: Path to the proccesed data directory
- `model_dir`: Directory to save checkpoint models
- `model`: Target model type
- `model_path`: Path to pretrained model  

You can get our pretrained proposed model [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1f0x8M4QYoRsB5T8FeM0K1hXF3nTa7cRf/view?usp=sharing).

### Converting an audio file
This script will perform singing voice conversion on the given audio file. For two-phase conversion, the intermediate files will be saved to `.tmp/` directory.   
`python inference.py $src_file $target_dir $singer_id $model_path --pitch-shift $pitch_shift --two-phase --train-data-dir $train_data_dir`  
- `src_file`: Path to the source audio file
- `target_dir`: Path to save the converted audio file
- `singer_id`: Target singer ID (name)
- `model_path`: Model path
- `pitch_shift`: Factor of pitch shifting performed on conversion, or "auto" for automatic pitch range shifting
- `two_phase`: Whether or not to perform two-phase conversion
- `train_data_dir`: The original training data used for two-phase conversion

`python test_network.py $target_net`

### Evaluation
#### Data selection
